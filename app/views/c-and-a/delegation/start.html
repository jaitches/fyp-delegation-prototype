        <p>
          You can allow an authorised person to view your pensions if they have asked you to do so.
        </p>        
        <p>
          An authorised person is:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>a financial advisor</li>
          <div class="govuk-radios__divider">or</div>
          <li>someone who gives guidance on behalf of the Money and Pensions Service</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The person you delegate access to will only be able to view your pensions. They will not be able to carry out any transactions on your pensions.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a time limit that the person will be able to view your pensions. The maximum amount of time you can give access is 3 months.
        </p>
