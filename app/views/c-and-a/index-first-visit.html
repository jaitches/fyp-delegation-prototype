        Pension Finder will contact every pension provider in the UK to find out if you have a pension with them. Before we do that you will need to:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>verify your identity</li>
        <li>consent to the processing of your personal data within the service, so that we can find your pensions and you can view them on MoneyHelper</li>
      </ul>
